    Test whether level 1 outbound reporting in phase 5 works by testing whether rule 980140 is triggered.
    For these tests, existing test are repurposed with different assertions. Instead of asserting that the original
    rules are triggered that the tests are written for, we assert that triggering these rules causes the corresponding
    reporting rules to be triggered.
tests:
  - test_title: 980140-0
    desc: Test is basically identical to 953120-0 (PHP leakage positive test in phase 4) but here we assert that level 1 outbound reporting is triggered
    stages:
      - stage:
          input:
            dest_addr: "127.0.0.1"
            port: 80
            headers:
              Host: "localhost"
              User-Agent: "OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set"
              Accept: "text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5"
              Accept-Charset: "ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7"
              Accept-Encoding: "gzip,deflate"
              Accept-Language: "en-us,en;q=0.5"
              Content-Type: "text/plain"
            method: "GET"
            version: "HTTP/1.0"
            uri: "/anything"
            data: <?php echo "Hello World!\n" ?>
          output:
            log_contains: "id \"980140\""
  - test_title: 980140-1
    desc: Test is basically identical to 953120-1 (PHP leakage negative test in phase 4) but here we assert that level 1 outbound reporting is not triggered
