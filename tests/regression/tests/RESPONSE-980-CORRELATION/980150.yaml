    Test whether level 2 outbound reporting in phase 5 works by testing whether rule 980150 is triggered.
    For these tests, existing test are repurposed with different assertions. Instead of asserting that the original
    rules are triggered that the tests are written for, we assert that triggering these rules causes the corresponding
    reporting rules to be triggered.
# Disabled because there are no outbound rules that have regression tests that could be triggered without blocking the
# request (which is necessary for rule 980150 to be triggered
# TODO: add such a test
