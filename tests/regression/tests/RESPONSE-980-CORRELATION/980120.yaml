    Test whether level 2 inbound reporting in phase 5 works by testing whether rule 980120 is triggered.
    For these tests, existing test are repurposed with different assertions. Instead of asserting that the original
    rules are triggered that the tests are written for, we assert that triggering these rules causes the corresponding
    reporting rules to be triggered.
tests:
  - test_title: 980120-0
    desc: Test is basically identical to 920350-1 (host header positive test in phase 1) but here we assert that the level 2 inbound reporting is triggered
    stages:
      - stage:
          input:
            dest_addr: "127.0.0.1"
            method: "GET"
            port: 80
            headers:
              User-Agent: "OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set"
              Host: "127.0.0.1"
              Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5
            protocol: "http"
            uri: "/"
          output:
            log_contains: "id \"980120\""
  - test_title: 980120-1
    desc: Test is basically identical to 920350-2 (host header negative test in phase 1) but here we assert that the level 2 inbound reporting is not triggered
    stages:
      - stage:
          input:
            dest_addr: "localhost"
            method: "GET"
            port: 80
            headers:
              User-Agent: "OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set"
              Host: "localhost"
              Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5
            protocol: "http"
            uri: "/"
          output:
            no_log_contains: "id \"980120\""
