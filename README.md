# OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)

The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls. The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the OWASP Top Ten, with a minimum of false alerts.

## CRS Resources

Please see the [OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set page](https://coreruleset.org/) to get introduced to the CRS and view resources on installation, configuration, and working with the CRS.

## Contributing to the CRS

We strive to make the OWASP ModSecurity CRS accessible to a wide audience of beginner and experienced users. We are interested in hearing any bug reports, false positive alert reports, evasions, usability issues, and suggestions for new detections.

[Create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues) to report a false positive or false negative (evasion). Please include your installed version and the relevant portions of your ModSecurity audit log.

[Sign up for our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/modsecurity-core-rule-set-project) to ask general usage questions and participate in discussions on the CRS. Also [here](https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set/index) you can find the archives for the previous mailing list.

[Join the #coreruleset channel on OWASP Slack](http://owaspslack.com) to chat about the CRS.
